# cate-desktop

## Overview

`cate-desktop` provides a desktop GUI for *Cate*, the ESA CCI Toolbox.

## Building from Sources

The only development tool initially required is the latest version [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). 
After installing Node.js, we use its Package Manager `npm` to install all other required project dependencies. 

Get the source code and locally install dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/CCI-Tools/cate-desktop.git
    cd cate-desktop
    npm install

To compile TypeScript to JavaScript:

    npm run compile

To execute the unit-tests:

    npm test

To perform end-to-end tests:

    npm run test:e2e

To run the application:
    
    npm start

To build platform installer executables:

    npm run dist

To build binary packages:

    npm run pack

## Development Tools

For building:

* [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html) provides Microsoft's TypeScript compiler `tsc`.
* [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) is used to create distribution packages and installers.

For testing:

* [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) unit-testing framework for Node.js.
* [chai](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/) adds Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) API to `mocha`. 
* [spectron](https://github.com/electron/spectron#application-api) for end-to-end testing of the GUI applications. See script `test:e2e` in `package.json`. 

Other tools:

* [rimraf](https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf) is Node's version of Unix `rm -rf`.


## Project Structure

`cate-desktop` uses a [two-package.json project structure](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder#two-packagejson-structure).

* Development dependencies are in `./package.json`
* Application dependencies are in `./app/package.json`

This is how the directory structure will look like after cloning the repo:

    cate-desktop/
    ├── app/                     # Electrion application directory 
    │   ├── resources/           # Application resources: icons, images
    │   ├── main.js              # Called from Electron's main process, see ./package.json
    │   ├── renderer.js          # Called by Electron's renderer process, see ./index.html
    │   ├── index.html           # Loaded by Electron's main process
    │   └── package.json         # Electron application definition 
    ├── src/                     # TypeScript application module sources
    │   ├── main/                # Modules that run in Electron's main process
    │   │   └── **/*.ts 
    │   └── renderer/            # Modules that run in Electron's renderer process
    │       ├── **/*.ts
    │       └── **/*.tsx
    ├── e2e/                     # End-to-end tests
    │   └── **/*.js
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .editorconfig            # see http://editorconfig.org/
    ├── tsconfig.json            # TS compiler configuration
    └── package.json             # Node package definition
  
After compilation, i.e. `npm run compile`:

    cate-desktop/
    └── app/                     
        ├── main/                # JS sources generated by compile script
        │   └── **/*.js 
        └── renderer/            # JS sources generated by compile script
            └── **/*.js 

After distribution (installer) building, i.e. `npm run dist`:

    cate-desktop/
    └──  dist/                   # Distributable application binaries
         └── *.* 

The setup of this project was inspired by 

* [electron-boilerplate](https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate) for the Electron part and by
* [Microsoft/TypeScriptSamples/jsx](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScriptSamples/tree/master/jsx)
  for the TypeScript + React part.

This project currently doesn't use any other build tools apart from `npm` and `tsc`, the TypeScript compiler. 
We'll one day want to have hot loading into Electron and then use a tool such as `webpack`. The TypeScript article 
[React & Webpack](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react-&-webpack.html) describes how to use 
TypeScript with webpack and React.
